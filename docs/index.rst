EzTao
=====
**EzTao** is a Python toolkit for conducting time-series analysis using continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. It uses `celerite`_ (a fast gaussian processes regression library) to compute the likelihood of a set of proposed CARMA parameters given the input time series. Comparing to existing tools for performing CARMA analysis in Python which use *Kalman filter* to evaluate the likelihood function (e.g., `Kali`_), **EzTao** offers a more scalable solution (see the `celerite paper`_ for a comparison).

**EzTao** consist of tools to both simulate CARMA processes and fit (maximum likelihood estimation or MLE) time series to CARMA models. The current version of **EzTao** is built on top of `celerite`_, future versions will take advantage of `celerite2`_ (still under active development) for a better integration with other probabilistic programing libraries such as `PyMC3`_.

Installation
------------
**EzTao** can be installed with `pip`_ using::

   pip install eztao
